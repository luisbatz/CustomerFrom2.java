Simple Messaging Program 
Company: Fred’s Shipping & Packaging
Software by: LBatz Software Inc.

The purpose of the program is to record messages taken by customer service representatives and sent to intended recipients in upper management or sales personnel. Most of the places I have worked in have an inefficient manner of managing communications. Employees that take phone calls are forced to take a message in writing or have to format an email to let someone know that they have a message or a customer is requesting a call back. The advantage of my simple program is that once the message has been sent, the recipient should know the following:

•	Who called
•	Time call came in
•	Name of person calling
•	Phone number to call

This should make communications simpler by making a simple message that will let management or sales personnel that someone called without having to read it in email form. 

This program is designed for any business that has a high volume of phone calls coming in. In some businesses, email is the only way of commutation between two employees. Sometimes the employee taking the calls may be an entry-level employee. This adds additional stress in having to format an email and sending it to a manager. This leaves a chance that the employee will not gather the information needed. The form will require certain fields to be filled before hitting the submit button. Those fields are Name, phone number and reason for call. This means that as the employee is taking the call he/she will know what information to ask for. This provides another way of training an employee as to what information is needed from a customer that is requesting a call back from someone at that company. This will lead to fewer mistakes, which will mean that there is more efficiency in business tasks. 

The technical function of the program is to provide a way of recording messages and sending them to a pre-filled list of company employees. Ideally, this should come from a database but this provides a few challenges. First is leaving it up to the message originator to look for the person that message needs to be sent to. For the sake of efficiency, this is not ideal. There may be two people with the same common name for example, in a company of 100 plus people there is a greater chance that people will share a very similar name. Common names create an issue because once the message is sent to that person, that person may not be the intended recipient. The recipient will then read the message and call the client but both may not have any idea of who or what the call is about. This is unprofessional and inefficient. This is why I would add a drop down menu to make sure that the correct recipient is targeted:

•	Mike P @ sales
•	Mike P @ management
•	John W @ Shipping
•	John W @ HR

Once the message is created and sent then it will sit in a cue for the recipient to see. Ideally you want the message to be stored in a database in case management wants to see the history of the message board. I would give administrative access to a few people in the company. This means that restricted access means that messages will not be deleted or attempt to be deleted from the database. This would ensure that the employees are doing their jobs and not following up with clients.
The overall purpose of the program is to add an additional layer of connection between two employees that would not regularly message each other. This would provide another channel of communication for a front office or customer service employee to send a message or higher-up without feeling pressured or intimidated by sending a simple message. The main goal is to help the business in efficiency and communications. I believe that this will help a small business with day-to-day tasks. 
The software should be easy to use and that means that it will be easy to train employees on. Assuming that there is no internal software administrator we can gladly supply full support. We can:

•	Adding and removing users
•	Trouble shooting if app is not working as intended
•	Warranty and satisfaction guarantees
•	App maintenance and upgrades 
•	Compliance support 
•	End user rules and regulations
•	External investigations

If the company has their own internal software managers then they can take care of many of the tasks needed to maintain the application. We would gladly work with any requests or change requests as long as they are reasonable. Program change requests are time consuming. That is why we ask for 5 business days when such requests are made. Requests can be made through your account manager, or may be requested in writing through our support department.
